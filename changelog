## Added
* Doors!
  * Your favorites from 1.12, the 7 remaining doors have finally been ported
  * Thanks to KoblizekXD for biting the bullet
* Rubber boat
  * Made from latex or synthetic rubber
  * A much less jankier alternative to the vanilla boat. Rotations are silky smooth and done via the strafe keys instead of based on the player's orientation
  * Won't break from ramming into blocks
  * Faster than a regular boat, but will decelerate quicker when there's nobody sitting in it, preventing the boat from drifting off too far when empty
* Exposure chamber
  * Now performs the particle transmutation recipes that were previously done in the crafting table
  * Stylish as hell
* Decoy missile
  * A cheap tier 1 missile that shows up on radar screens as tier 4 (eg. nuclear) missiles
* Printing press stamps
  * 8 different stamps for printing certain pages
  * If a meteor dungeon safe is generated without a black book inside, it will generate two random stamps instead
  * With all 8 stamps, allows you to print your own black book

## Changed
* Updated russian localization
* Reduced the blast resistance of the large doors from absurdly high to still very but not quite as high
* Custom missiles are now launchable using the radar
* NTM's structures should no longer spawn in dimensions besides the overworld. Ores will still generate, assuming the config option is set.
* Decreased M1tty's radiation resistance
  * It's really damn cheap, what did you expect
* M1tty's helmet now acts like a protective mask
* Most non-custom missiles except tier 0s are now assembled in the arc welder
  * Crafting complexity has been reduced, the recipes only need the three major components without any extra loose plates
* Non-custom missiles have been slightly buffed
  * Explosions are now slightly larger and they use the new cross-detection entity damage code which still affects entities behind small hills that would otherwise be shielded
  * Explosions now have a 2x larger entity damage radius
* Updated the digiminer recipe for mekanism compat
* Added config options to the ground water pumps
* Missile parts such as non-custom thrusters and fuselages are now made in the arc welder, recipe ingredients have been adjusted as well
* Null grenades now have a slightly larger radius, should no longer wipe playerdata and require UNDEFINED to make
* Added some breedable material to BFB PWR fuel rods, meaning that the recycling recipes now actually yield a net positive instead of being a massive waste of time
* The RBMK control panel has been upgraded
  * Right.clicking the color buttons will now assign the color to the selected control rods
  * There's now a new button that allows to cycle through compressor settings on RBMK steam channels
  * The flux display is now functional. It will display the flux curve of the last 30 seconds, as well as labels for the total flux level.
  * With the color assigning buttons and the flux display finished, the console is now finally complete
* Compressing blood at 4 PU now turns it into crude oil at a ratio of 2:1
* Increased the cap for the overdrive upgrade in acidizers, tier 2 should now yield the proper amount and tier 3 should now be better than tier 2
* The tooltip of valid upgrades now changes when a compatible machine GUI is open

## Fixed
* Fixed ancient bug where custom missiles launched using the launch table would not use the accuracy calculation and always be pin-point accurate
* Fixed RBMK heat exchangers being able to use heatable fluids that don't have heat exchanger efficiency defined like liquid sodium, heavy water and thorium salt
* Fixed RBMK heat exchangers not using the heat exchanger efficiency variable to determine cooling power
* Fixed the ballistic gauntlet spawning a client-side ghost bullet that doesn't move or despawn
* Fixed bug where different custom machine cores would merge in a stack when picked up, turning them into the same type
* Fixed radar screen blips being visible through the back of the model
* Fixed desh crate's last half of slots preventing radiation entirely
* Fixed large mining drill shift-clicking
